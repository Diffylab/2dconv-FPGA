2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance u_bram_1/BRAM_reg, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sw[0] relative to clock(s) CLK, sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sw[1] relative to clock(s) CLK, sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sw[2] relative to clock(s) CLK, sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sw[3] relative to clock(s) CLK, sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on uart_txd_in relative to clock(s) CLK, sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on uart_rxd_out relative to clock(s) CLK, sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>
